# Continuous Calendar for Obsidian

*A year-at-a-glance calendar that turns your vault into a lightweight personal planner.*


>[!IMPORTANT] Why another calendar?
>Monthly views chop weeks in half and hide adjacent days on separate pages. A **continuous calendar** lines the whole year up—week by week—so you can spot gaps, overlaps, and long-range deadlines at a glance. Think of it as the Kanban board for time itself.



## Main features

| 📌 | What it does | Why it matters |
|----|--------------|----------------|
| **Year grid view** | Renders the 52-week matrix inline in Obsidian’s right sidebar. | See the whole year without scrolling between months. |
| **Daily-notes** | Pulls or create your Daily Notes | Jump to any day’s note with a click. |
| **Front-matter events** | Any note with `date:` (or `dateStart` + `dateEnd`) turns into an event or a multiday bar. | Tie projects, trips, tasks, etc. directly to their dates. |
| **Birthdays** | Reads `birthday:` from notes in your chosen “People” folder or vault and repeats them every year. | Never forget cake again. |
| **Official holidays** | Fetches holidays for selected countries via **date-holidays** and stores them in markdown for offline use. | Background tint instantly tells you “day off”. |
| **Color & symbol rules** | Override colors per-note *or* set default colors/symbols per tag. | Fast visual categorisation without messing with CSS. |
| **Click-to-expand** | Click any day to pop open a list of events/birthdays/notes with live links. | No more hunting dots with tooltips. |
| **Focus & opacity toggles** | Fade or highlight whole months to declutter past/future noise. | Great for quarter planning. |
